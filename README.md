# Houbolt_Jr-PressurizationSystem

The inital research was docummentd in `Feed System and Injector Analysis.xlsx`. The python code translated the excel into an OOP code, and made a few corrections to the initial documentation. User should import the following packages into a fresh `.py` code. 

	from Pressurization_pkg.Utilities import *
	from Pressurization_pkg.componentClass import *
	from Pressurization_pkg.PressureSystem import PressureSystem

The file should be saved immediately outside of the `Pressurization_pkg` package. 

See `example.py` for a sample use case.
